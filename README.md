# Coursera: Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains my solutions for the assignments of the "[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)" course in Coursera, which is taught by Mr. Andrew Ng. Feel free to raise a pull request if any mistakes are found :)

P.S. Octave 7.1.0 is used for all assignments.
